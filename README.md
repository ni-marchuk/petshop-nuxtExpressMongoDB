## Build an isomorphic application with Nuxt and Node

Isomorphic applications, also known as Universal JavaScript applications are JavaScript applications that preload data using server-side rendering before running the application on the client-side. This ensures that all content is available for crawlers and other bots to index.

This repository holds the code for a server-side rendered pet adoption website, built with Nuxt and Node. 

## Prerequisite

MongoDB
Npm
Node

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open two terminal instances.
3. In the first terminal, navigate into the `backend` directory and start the Node server - `node index.js`.
4. In the second terminal, navigate into the `frontend` directory and start the development server - `npm run dev`.

## Testing
1. Once both servers are running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ on your web browser.
2. Play around with the application.

## Built With
MongoDB - MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
Nuxt - Nuxt is a progressive framework based on Vue, it is used to create modern server-side rendered web applications.git
